**Redux Toolkit:**

### Redux Overview

**Redux** is a state management library that centralizes and manages application state effectively. It operates on three main components:

1. **Actions**: 
   - Plain JavaScript objects with a `type` property.
   - Describe state changes but do not modify the state themselves.

2. **Reducers**:
   - Pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments.
   - Update and return a new state based on the dispatched action.

3. **Store**:
   - A single state container that holds the applicationâ€™s entire state.
   - Manages state updates and subscriptions for UI components.

### Redux Workflow
1. A user performs an action (e.g., clicks a button).
2. An action is dispatched, which the reducer uses to update the state.
3. The updated state triggers a re-render of the UI.

### Benefits of Redux Toolkit

**Why Choose Redux Toolkit Over Standard Redux?**
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Simplifies store configuration and reduces the amount of code needed to set up actions and reducers.
- **Cleaner Code**: Fosters more readable and maintainable code.
- **Core Libraries Included**: Comes with built-in configurations and utilities, eliminating the need for multiple packages.
- **Simplified Reducer Logic**: Streamlines the process of writing reducers with clear and concise functions.

**Getting Started with Redux Toolkit**

**Step 1: Install Packages**
To begin using Redux Toolkit and React-Redux in your application, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

This sets the foundation for managing state in a more efficient and cleaner way compared to traditional Redux.
